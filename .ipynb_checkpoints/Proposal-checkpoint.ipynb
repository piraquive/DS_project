    "We will be looking to find correlations between professors and their student’s success.   We hope to find trends that we can present for the purpose of bettering experiences for students.  We are both Mechanical Engineering students, and over the course of our education here at the University of Utah, it seems there are beliefs that \"Professors only care about their research here\" and \"Professors don’t care about the success of their students, they only teach because it’s required by the University\".  We want to find out if such accusations have any validity. "

    "We want to see all the correlations between what makes a professor successful, or not, and how a professor's life, characteristics, and agenda affect their students.  More specifically we want to see if things like the amount of research a professor completes, their salary, their education, their hometown, or anything else about them, can affect their students in any way.  Answering these questions may reveal some hidden relationships that have been either developing recently, or have been existent for some time.  We also are considering making comparisons between the University of Utah and other similar and competitive Universities.  In addition to answering the aforementioned questions, we hope to better our skills in data scraping, data visualization, and data interpretation. \n",

    "The OBIA provides an extremely wide data set we will need to trim and clean. To do so, we need to identify which variables and predictors have the largest ability to reveal professor/student success relationships.  The data extraction portion will not be very intensive because the data is readily available for scraping. We expect most our work to involve cleaning the data, creating dataframes, and mining these dataframes for the richest data. "

    "To begin analyzing our data, we will look for positive and negative linear relationships when plotting two variables against each other, which will require many two variable plots.  After getting some idea of how the data may be correlated, we might begin multivariable plotting, looking at correlation coefficient matrices, and possibly incorporating heatmaps.  From here, we may build decision trees or support vector machines to test our ability to classify students, or professors into their respective chosen categories.  Through testing different K and C values in our classifying methods, we can optimize the methods for best accuracy.  This will help determine if headers like professor rank and status will affect student success.\n"
